Documentation
-------------
Please read the documentation and tutorial at https://mrfiltering.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Applications
------------
- Subtract compact objects from low-resolution images (such as Dragonfly) to reveal low surface brightness features.
- Characterize and subtract stellar halos in Dragonfly image.
- Download corresponding high resolution image (HSC, CFHT) of given Dragonfly image.

Examples
------------
This example shows the tidal feature of NGC 5907, described in [van Dokkum et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190611260V/abstract). The images presented there used this algorithm. Full resolution Dragonfly images and MRF results can be found [here](https://www.pietervandokkum.com/ngc5907). Check [this notebook](https://github.com/AstroJacobLi/mrf/blob/master/examples/NGC5907/mrfTask-n5907.ipynb) for more details in how to do MRF using this Python package! :rocket:

This example shows how powerful MRF is in revealing low surface brightness features. The ultra-diffuse galaxy M101-DF3 is revealed by MRF after subtracting compact objects and bright star halos according to [van Dokkum et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12867). Check [this notebook](https://github.com/AstroJacobLi/mrf/blob/master/examples/M101-DF3/mrfTask-m101df3.ipynb) for more details.

You can also use [this script](https://github.com/AstroJacobLi/mrf/blob/master/examples/mrf-task.py) to run the MRF task. Take NGC 5907 as an example:

```bash
python mrf-task.py n5907_df_g.fits ngc5907_cfht_g.fits ngc5907_cfht_r.fits ngc5907-task.yaml --galcat='gal_cat_n5907.txt' --output='n5907_g'
```

Installation
------------

```bash
mkdir <install dir>
cd <install dir>
git clone git@github.com:AstroJacobLi/mrf.git
cd mrf
python setup.py install
```

If you don't have `git` configured, you can also download the `zip` file directly from https://github.com/AstroJacobLi/mrf/archive/master.zip, then unzip it and install in the same way. 

To test whether `mrf` is installed successfully, import `mrf` in Python:

```python
import mrf, os
print(os.path.isfile(os.path.join(mrf.__path__[0], 'iraf/macosx/x_images.e')))
```
`True` means you have installed `mrf` successfully! Bravo!

If you need to use ``lanczos`` or ``cubic`` interpolation, you must have [``galsim``](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim) installed. You will also need [``unagi``](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/unagi) to download HSC images. `Python>=3` is needed, but you can try whether `mrf` still works under `python2`. Check out the dependence of `mrf` depends from `requirements.txt`.
