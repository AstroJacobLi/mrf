Changelog
---------
* 2019-09-05: Sometimes it would be wrong when using ``iraf`` to magnify image then using ``reproject``. If the high-res image after color correction is all NaN, please use other interpolation methods such as `lanczos` or `cubic`.
 
* 2019-08-28: Remove dependence on IRAF, while users could still using IRAF methods if they have configured environmental path correctly.

* 2019-08-23: Version 1.0.1 released.
